The developer should first look the (lab_3.java) in the repository to see how the code work.
Then, one should check the inputfile(lab3_chart.txt) to see if match with the result in the output file
Last, check the data in the output file and make sure it is in correct format and structure.


The lab 3 are similar to lab 2, but add more to it.
I spent alot of time figure out how to insert the correct data in array, and finally find the conclusion.
